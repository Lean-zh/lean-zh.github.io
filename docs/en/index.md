## Introduction to Lean

Lean is an Interactive Theorem Prover (ITP) and a general-purpose functional programming language. Developed by Microsoft Research in 2013, it allows mathematicians to convert mathematical theorems into code and input them into Lean for verification. When considered as a programming language, Lean is a strict pure functional language with dependent types.

In terms of formalization, Lean provides a rigorous logical and mathematical framework, allowing users to conduct precise reasoning and proof. This feature makes Lean very useful in mathematical and computer science research, as it can help researchers discover and correct conceptual errors, and also enable them to gain a deeper understanding of their research subjects. Many mathematicians choose to use Lean's standard library, mathlib, as a foundation, which is referred to as the [library of the future for mathematics](https://www.quantamagazine.org/building-the-mathematical-library-of-the-future-20201001/).
